1. Distribution of Content by Type

grep "Movie" filtered_netflix_titles.csv | awk -F, '{type[$2]++} END {print "Movies:", type["Movie"]}' > content_distribution.csv

grep "TV Show" filtered_netflix_titles.csv | awk -F, '{type[$2]++} END {print "TV Shows:", type["TV Show"]}' >> content_distribution.csv

2. Country-Specific Content Production

#!/bin/bash
# Path to your CSV file
csv_path="netflix_titles.csv"
# Path to the country list
country_list="all_countries.txt"

# Prepare output file
output_file="country_counts.txt"
echo "Country counts:" > "$output_file"

# Check each country
while IFS= read -r country; do
  # Prepare the grep pattern to include possible quotes and handle comma separation
  pattern="$country"
  # Use grep to count occurrences, considering the country could be part of a list in a single field
  count=$(grep -o "$pattern" "$csv_path" | wc -l)
  echo "$country: $count" >> "$output_file"
done < "$country_list"

echo "Results saved to $output_file"

3. Content Rating and Target Audiences

#!/bin/bash
csv_path="netflix_titles.csv"
rating_list="all_ratings.txt"
output_file="rating_distribution.txt"

# Clear the output file to start fresh
> "$output_file"

echo "Starting the rating count..."

while IFS= read -r rating; do
  # Prepare the grep pattern to match any occurrence of the rating
  pattern=",$rating,"
  # Use grep to count occurrences, considering the rating could appear anywhere in a line
  count=$(grep -c "$pattern" "$csv_path")
  echo "$rating: $count" >> "$output_file"
  echo "Processed $rating: $count occurrences"  # Debugging line to monitor progress
done < "$rating_list"

echo "Rating counting completed."
